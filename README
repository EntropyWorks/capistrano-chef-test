The goal is to make deploying a chef-server on ubuntu as repeatable as possible.

This is a Capistrano base deployment. https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki 

Done:

 * Install rvm to manage ruby and its gems
 * Install chef under rvm cleanly 
 * Fix init.d scripts for chef to work with rvm
 
Need to do:
 
 * Add servers as clients to chef via Capistrano
 * Setup apache to proxy chef webgui
 * Change default webgui password during deployment
 * Deploy an apache test site besides chef
